Personal machine learning projects

## irisLearning.ipynb
Machine learning project to predict flower species given various flower petal measurements. 

Six algorithms are used:
Logistic Regression (LR),
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Classification and Regression Trees (CART),
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB),
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Algorithm accuracies were compared in a confusion matrix.
 
 
## titanic
Directory containing data sets and a machine learning project to predict the survivors of the Titanic. The same algorithms as above were tested and compared.
