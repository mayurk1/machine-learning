Machine learning project to predict flower species given various flower petal measurements. 

Six algorithms are used:
Logistic Regression (LR),
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Classification and Regression Trees (CART),
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB),
Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Algorithm accuracies were compared in a confusion matrix.
